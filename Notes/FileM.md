# File Management - READ ME FIRST

I classify the files into 4 categories, including **_data_**, **_code_**, **_document_** and **_others_**. Each file / folder has a backup. Here are some hints about the locations of the files / folders.

> Please note that (M) represents the main files for modifications, (B) represents backup. (B-xd/w/m/y) means backup the files every x day / week / month / year. (We omit x if x = 1.)

## Data

The data is saved in 2 main locations:

- HardDrive (Segate 5T)
- OneDrive (fweiab 5T)

### HardDrive

- TAQMSEC - raw / 1s / 1min / 5min (M)
- Project data (B-w)
- Important data tables (B-m)

### OneDrive

- Project data (M)
- Important data tables (M)
- TAQMSEC (B-3m in `fweiab` if we have another HKU account.)

Note: Move the project data & important data tables to the new account if we have one in the future.

## Code

The code is mainly saved on GitHub and moodified locally / on a remote server.

- GitHub (? storage space)
- Local `GitHub` file
- Remote server
